# Tutorial: How to implement Jaeger and Opentracing as tracing middleware.

This repo contains the code (which is subject to changes!) for an upcoming OpenTracing & Jaeger step-by-step tutorial.

TODO:
- Add link to written blog post - this is being drafted.
- Add link to any video tutorials.
- Endpoint should make an external service call to be able to demonstrate how child spans work. Trying to find the easiest external service call that the endpoint could make in order to demonstrate this!
- Add instructions to this README on how to build the binary, add the Jaeger all-in-one container, run the server, make a curl request, and access the Jaeger UI to see the traces. Screenshots of the UI would be nice too.
