# Tutorial: How to implement Jaeger and Opentracing as tracing middleware.

This repo contains the code (which is subject to changes!) for an upcoming OpenTracing & Jaeger step-by-step tutorial.

TODO:
- Link written blog post - this is being drafted.
- Link any video tutorials will be added here in the future.
- Endpoint should make an external service call to be able to demonstrate how child spans work. Trying to find the easiest external service call that the endpoint could make in order to demonstrate this!
- Add instructions to this README on how to build the binary, run the server, make a curl request, and open the Jaeger UI.
